Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   the largest order is `O(3^n)` so we are working with an exponential order so we can simplify it to `O(C^n)`

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   and based upon the returns for the recursive functions they only ever return 1 thing therefore a space of `O(n)` is used

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
